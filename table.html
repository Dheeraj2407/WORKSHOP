        <p title="I'm a story">Once upon a time there was a king who was very kind and generous. 
            People in his kingdom were very happy and prosperous.
            Often he would disguise himself and go among people to know the state of affairs first-hand.
            <br><br> He felt very happy that all the people in his kingdom were leading a happy life. 
            They had all they needed to live happily.</p>
